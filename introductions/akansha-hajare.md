## Introduction
I am a dedicated and proactive individual with hands-on experience in web development, event management, and cloud computing. Recently, I completed a fall internship with IEEE Bombay in Nagpur, Maharashtra, where I contributed to the development of a full-stack web application, optimized loading processes with custom CSS loaders, and collaborated effectively with cross-functional teams. I have a solid foundation in Git, GitHub, and version control.

In addition, as a Student Representative for ISTE CCOEW since July 2022, I have successfully managed and executed various events, from planning to implementation, ensuring they met the needs of diverse student audiences. My role involved organizing seminars, workshops, and quizzes, and fostering relationships with vendors and sponsors to secure partnerships.

As a member of the Google Developer Student Clubs since August 2022, I have gained proficiency in software development, cloud computing, and CI/CD pipelines. I successfully completed the Google Arcade program, which further enhanced my skills in deploying, managing, and scaling applications using Google Cloud Platform.
