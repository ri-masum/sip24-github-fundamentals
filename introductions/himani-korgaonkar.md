## Introduction
Hey there! Iâ€™m Himani Korgaonkar, currently pursing my Master's in Information Technology at Vidyalankar School of Information Technology. Coding is my passion, and I'm constantly intrigued by the worlds of data science, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. Beyond the digital realm, you'll often find me soaking up the tranquility of nature, finding my zen through yoga, or catching up with friends over a cup of coffee.
